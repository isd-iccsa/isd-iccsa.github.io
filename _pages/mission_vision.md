This workshop will bring together researchers, engineers, and policymakers to discuss how intelligent systems can transform data from satellites, sensors, and digital twins into actionable insights that lead to a more sustainable future. Environmental sustainability increasingly depends on computational models capable of representing and predicting large-scale natural processes such as climate variability, soil dynamics, and water resources.

However, translating AI and simulation models into operational, real-world systems remains a major challenge. ISD was conceived to bridge this gap, aligning computational science, environmental modeling, and sustainability research through interdisciplinary collaboration.

This directly supports ICCSA’s vision by applying advanced computational methods to socially relevant domains, thereby reinforcing the contribution of computational science to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The workshop aims to build a vibrant research network that connects theoretical innovation with practical environmental applications. It will foster collaboration across disciplines and countries, encourage the development of reproducible and open AI frameworks, and highlight case studies where computational science has enabled measurable progress toward sustainability.
